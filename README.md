Ever find yourself deleting whatever you write as soon as you type it out? I certainly do.

This plugin aims to solve that by disabling all the delete functions (backspace, delete key, Ctrl+x) in Obsidian. Anything you write will stay there, giving it the kind of permanence akin to writing with a pen on paper.

The goal isn't to get perfect, typo-free writing on the first try, but rather to be accepting of flaws, so you can focus on getting the ideas down first, and only then do some editing in a later pass.

This is the plugin version of [digital paper](https://github.com/danferns/digital-paper), a minimal web app that does the same thing.

## Usage

Enable / Disable the "paper mode" by opening the command palette (Ctrl+P) and typing "digital paper: Toggle digital paper mode". 

When enabled, Obsidian's status bar will display the text "paper". 

## Feedback

You can DM me `@thepianodan` on Discord, or ping me on the official Obsidian Discord server for feedback, bug reports, and feature requests. If you don't use Discord, you can also email me at `dannywritescode@gmail.com`.
